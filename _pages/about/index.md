# Who we are

The Friends of the Bluffton Nature Preserve is an informal community group of people interested in supporting the Bluffton University Nature Preserve. It is not officially affiliated with Bluffton University.

# What we do

At the present time, the main purpose of the group is to provide communications for upcoming events happening at the preserve through posts on this website and notifications through the [email list](https://groups.google.com/g/friendsofbnp). In the future, the group may sponsor informal walks through the preserve.
